# Notes from Sedgewick course

* Quick find problem - Union Find
* Brute force solution has complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Better solution is to use the quick find.  It has O(n) complexity


### Percolation
* Percolation: A phenomena to find if in an NxN grid, the top and bottom open sites are connected. 
* Percolation also relates to Monte Carlo simulation.

### Analysis of Algorithms
* Programmers solve a problem, clients worry about efficiency and budget, theroreticians worry about the inner workings.  
* Charles Babbage quote on analytical engines.
* Discreet Fourier transforms algorithm case study.  N body simulation case study.
* Insight: Use scientific method to understand performance in operations.
* Scientific Method:
    + Observe, Hypothesize, Predict, Verify, Validate.
    + Principles: Reproducible experiments, Falsifiable hypothesis
